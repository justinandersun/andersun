Leprechauns Patricia and Patrick collect lucky objects, such as rabbit’s feet and four-leaf clovers. But their approaches are wildly different. Patricia is a hard worker—spending 17 hours per day scouring fields for a four-leaf clover. She’s regimented, but she’s too busy to tell anyone about it. A friend could’ve pointed her to a quiet meadow teeming in four-leaf clovers. Patrick, however, won’t shut up about his project. He tells all his friends, informs strangers at the pub, and cold-calls horseshoe manufacturers around the globe. A helpful hunter once gave Patrick a special unicorn lasso, but Patrick’s been too lazy to use it.

Neither Patricia nor Patrick find success in collecting lucky objects.

They need to expand their **[Luck Surface Area](https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area)**. Any success involves some degree of luck, but it’s possible to unlock more luck. Consider this formula:

**Luck = Doing x Telling**

Patrick talks a lot, but he’s not putting in the effort, so nothing happens.
