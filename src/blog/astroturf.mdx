An army of Twitter bots disguised as real people complain about cannibal rights.

> “The meatpacking industry is suppressing #CannibalRights!”
> 
> “#FreeOurDiet from Big Meat’s stranglehold”
> 
> “People have eaten people for centuries. Suppressing #cannibalism is cultural erasure!”

Next, real Twitter accounts catch onto the idea due to herd instincts and a desire to hop on the “bandwagon.”

> “Not a cannibal, but big companies shouldn’t tell anyone what to put in our bodies! #CannibalRights”

Then, real people flood the streets outside a meatpacking HQ to protest anti-cannibalism and demand human flesh.

To appease the people, the meat company issues a press release about their new meat product: Human.

In this example, the meat company used “sock puppets” (Twitter bots) to instigate a movement that would create social support for their new business line.

Astroturfing is an organized activity intended to create a false impression of a widespread movement. AstroTurf is a synthetic grass used for sports fields to resemble grassroots, and astroturfing uses artificial information designed to resemble grassroots movements.

Whether the death of Caesar, the **[Louisiana Church scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coushatta_(Better_Call_Saul))** in *Better Call Saul*, Ryan Holiday’s **[Tucker Max billboard](https://www.slideshare.net/ryanholiday/9-tactics-of-a-media-manipulator-how-to-control-and-influence-blogs/)**, or the National Smokers Alliance 1993 campaign, astroturfing creates real-world impact from fake information.
