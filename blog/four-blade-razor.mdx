“Razors” are critical thinking tools designed to “shave away” complexity, and some are especially useful. Stay sharp with Turtle’s new four-blade razor!

1. **Occam’s Razor**: The simplest explanation is often the best.
2. **Hanlon’s Razor**: Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to laziness.
3. **Hitchen’s Razor**: If asserted without evidence, it can be dismissed without evidence.
4. **Alder’s Razor**: If it can’t be settled with experiment or observation, it’s unworthy of debate.

Razors are useful but dangerous. As most people don’t shave off their eyebrows, not all situations require a razor. Hard subjects are ripe for razors: Science, math, business. Soft subjects aren’t: Human behavior, literature, topics of faith. If you come to nuanced issues with a razor, you might hurt yourself and others.
