We’re all designers. Whether we create slide decks, flyers, or menus, it’s helpful to learn design basics—like color.

When done right, color elevates content. When done wrong, it tarnishes credibility. A few tips to get color right:

1. **Align to values**. In Western cultures, blue = trust/safety, green = nature/cleanliness, red = life/energy.
2. **Less is more**. Limit yourself to one primary and a couple of secondary colors.
3. **Use a palette**. Although design can feel “squishy” and subjective, color coordination is scientific. **[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)** is a free tool to generate a palette of 5 colors. Use these auto-generated colors and they’ll outperform guesswork.
