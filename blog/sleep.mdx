I'm a notoriously poor sleeper, so I've spent time and energy researching and experimenting ways to improve sleep quality and quantity.

## Tips
Here are a few things I've learned that are useful:
- Human adults require 7-9 hours per night
- Averaging below 7 hours per night has many negative outcomes
- Cease eating for 2-3 hours before bedtime (for most people, this means no food after 20:00)
- Have a fixed wakeup time
- Limit blue light (i.e., screens) 2 hours before bed
- Use blackout curtains
- Make your bedroom as cold as possible
- Use the Scandanavian bedding method (i.e., separate blankets) to minimize partner disruption
- Limit caffeine, no more than 1-2 cups of coffee 10 hours before bed (for most people, this means no coffee or energy drinks after 12:00)

## Science
Here are some interesting scientific findings about sleep systems:
- Adenosine / sleep debt
- Circadian rhythms / jet lag
- Melatonin production
- Larks & owls
- Sleep stages / REM & NREM
