I’m forever surprised by the strength of imprints. Despite overwhelming evidence that says otherwise, sugary breakfast cereals never *feel* unhealthy. This bias makes us hesitant to new ways of learning, doing, and thinking. Consider basic math.

I learned to add 156+249 like this:

Although it looks more complicated, the new approach is easier for mental math and ultimately more helpful.
