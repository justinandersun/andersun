You can’t help but wonder: Is this the right problem?

Brainstorming is fine, but you might solve the wrong problem without the right frame.

**[Framestorming](https://academy.nobl.io/use-a-framestorm-to-generate-new-ideas/)** is a method to generate multiple questions and problems before considering solutions. In the words of Einstein: “If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes solving it.”

Back at Silicon Farm, the team framestorms:

- Move to California?
- Increase the talent pool?
- Have a better lifestyle for the team?
- Improve the CEO’s status?

The team discovers the right problem is increasing the talent pool since Silicon Farm has a small population relative to California. With this reframe, they can brainstorm other solutions. They might improve their talent pipeline with career fairs, offer remote work, or launch exciting projects to attract curious minds.

Framestorming helps you know if a yarn ball is worth unraveling.
