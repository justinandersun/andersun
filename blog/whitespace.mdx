Writing is more than words.

It’s how we present words.

Whitespace is a neglected element—not a passive background but an active ingredient for expressing a thought. Adding space to writing gives readers breathing room and makes content more palatable. Whether writing articles, emails, or text messages, whitespace provides clarity.

Four ways to use whitespace:

1. **Variable sentence length**. Too many short, choppy sentences are unprofessional, but too many long-winded sentences become overwhelming. Mix them up: Long, short, short, long, long, short. Like Morse Code.
2. **Short paragraphs**. Under three sentences per paragraph is a good rule of thumb.
3. **Bullet points and numbered lists**. Need I say more?
4. **Visual elements**. Relevant charts, tables, and bad doodles break up the monotony of words.
